and xev to check what key and button presses generate.

how to set keybindings manually:

( bind-keys keymap "keybinding" 'action )

for example:

( bind-keys global-keymap "W-Tab" 'cycle-windows )

how to unset keybindings manually:

( unbind-keys keymap "keybindings" 'action )

for example:

( unbind-keys global-keymap "W-Tab" 'cycle-windows )

another thing would be nested keybindings (I prefer `macros' instead of `nested keyinbindgs'),
like in emacs. nested means you first press keys which together act as a new modifier
(this new modifier works like the compose key does -> you don't have to keep it pressed, like other modifiers),
then you press another key (or keybinding) to actually perform the desired action, example:

;; create a new meta-keymap called apps-keymap
( define apps-keymap ( make-keymap ) )

;; glue it into the global-keymap, make the apps-keymap modifier W-e (WM-Modifier + e)
( bind-keys global-keymap "W-e" apps-keymap )

;; add bindings to the apps-keymap
( bind-keys apps-keymap "b" '( system "bluefish &" ) )

now first press "W-e" (as I said no need to keep it pressed) and press b, now bluefish starts.
