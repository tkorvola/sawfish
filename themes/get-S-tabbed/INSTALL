To use this theme, you'll need to do slightly more than just unpack it and
select it.  After untarring, add this to your sawfish config:

  (defvar-setq default-frame-style 'get-S-tabbed "Default frame style")
  (custom-set-typed-variable 'tab-left-dec-width '5 'number)
  (custom-set-typed-variable 'tab-right-dec-width '5 'number)
  (custom-set-typed-variable 'tab-left-margin '14 'number)
  (custom-set-typed-variable 'tab-right-margin '38 'number)
  ; choose whatever font you like...
  (custom-set-typed-variable 
    (quote default-font) (quote ("Pango" . "Sans 10")) (quote font))

I don't yet have a way to get those tab-* variables directly from the theme to
the tab layout code, so it's currently necessary to configure them manually.
