Simple & Elegant (a Sawfish theme)
----------------

Version 0.05

To be used with a corresponding GTK+ theme
[http://gtk.themes.org/themes.phtml?themeid=951420422]
and a Uniread font from Linux Font Project
[http://dreamer.nitro.dk/linux/lfp].

My goal is to make THE ULTIMATE GOOD THEME (TM),
and this theme is my *current* visualization/interpretation
of that goal. This will be the only (Sawfish) theme by me.

I cannot deny you from forking this theme, but I beg you not
to. If you want to make the theme better, please submit your
ideas to me instead of trying to implement them in your
forked theme.
